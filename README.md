# BCM Theme
## A vscode theme for people with blue-cone monochromatism

I was born with blue-cone monochromatism, a form of achromatopsia.  From the time that I first used a computer in the late 80's, color and contrast have continued to be an issue.  For me, dark backgrounds and high contrast provide the best working experience, but themes designed for people who see all colors don't always provide the contrast that I need.  I can't read red-on-black, and yellow/orange/green don't provide much contrast with eachother.  Similarly, blue/purple/pink don't provide any contrast with eachother.

Ideally, I would use light blues on black, and a mix of yellow, white, and some darker colors. Working  as a developer, I find that this creates a lot of issues for my co-workers when performing code reviews.  As a compromise, I'm using light purples and greens with black to give the contrast that I need and the contrast that I can share, and the result is this theme.
